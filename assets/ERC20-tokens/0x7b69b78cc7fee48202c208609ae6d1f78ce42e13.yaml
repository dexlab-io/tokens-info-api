  Goal Bonanza is a self-regulating, blockchain powered football betting platform based on ERC20 token
  standard. It offers fresh and new football betting experience by combining lottery like crowd betting
  on 10 possible football game final score outcomes where the crowd drives the potential returns, unlike
  traditional bookmakers and betting exchanges that offer unattractive odds and low returns. The bigger
  the crowd the bigger are the potential returns easily reaching six figures. In simple terms, imagine
  $100,000+ in returns on 1$ bet by successfully predicting the final score of a football game out of
  10 possible outcomes. That is Goal Bonanza and much more.
