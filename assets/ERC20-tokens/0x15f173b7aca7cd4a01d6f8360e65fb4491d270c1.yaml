  eReal is for the community, we believe that sharing is a key factor to any successful community, based
  on that, we'll be offering 99% of all eREAL. With eReal, users can enjoy the features of a decentralized
  currency, which is free and independent, while still being sure that their private information is protected.
  Brazil, like many other countries, has suffered the consequences of the 2007 financial crisis. This
  crisis was largely due to the "mismanagement" of central and private banks, the same private banks that
  during the crisis peak were "bailed out" by governments with taxpayers' money, all in the name of "financial
  stability". We want to break this vicious circle and share, not only the money advantages, but also
  the power, which is invaluably more precious. eREAL is more than a coin, it's a movement in the direction
  of a shift in power between US and THEM, the elites, the banks, the media and the governments. Together
  we'll prevail.
