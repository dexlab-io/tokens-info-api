  StakeIt Token (STAKE) is a community-driven investment token allowing token holders to stake their tokens
  on a daily basis without any withdrawal or date limits through a centralized banking system. Token holders
  are required to pay small fees in ETH whenever depositing or withdrawing, and all revenues generated
  are used to buy-back and destroy tokens.
