  CareCoin Community idea was conceived by a group of 6 blockchain enthusiast individuals highly motivated
  to bring into existence a global open-access interactive digitized platform using blockchain technology
  which enables people across the globe to provide monetary assistance to their fellow human beings in
  need. The idea is to keep the functionality and design of the platform very user-friendly so everyday
  people, even the ones who are less computer savvy, find it easy to interact with. You may ask, why one
  would need CareCoin platform when there is already a platform like gofundme.com. Well, there is no doubt
  gofundme.com is a great initiative in this approach, however, it lacks a functional mechanism to protect
  the donors against fraudsters; furthermore, a considerable percentage of donations are deducted as fees
  before the funds are released to the donees. CareCoin Community promises to develop an autonomous community
  consensus-driven global donation ecosystem which protects against fraudsters and ultimately eliminates
  the fees completely so every penny donated by a donor is utilized by the donee.
