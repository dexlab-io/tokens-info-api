  The Soviet Union Ruble is a cryptocurrency (private internet currency), that has a value based on the
  current market. In other words, Soviet Union Ruble is an entirely decentralized open source worldwide
  currency, without any central authority. This means that your transactions will not be managed or verified
  by any traditional banking institution. Users can now control their own finances privately. Soviet Union
  Ruble is built on Ethereum, a next generation blockchain protocol enabling advanced smart contracts.
  Ethereum is censorship resistant, globally available, and provides transparent guarantees about future
  operations of the platform. With Ethereum, we can eliminate middlemen and counterparty risk.
