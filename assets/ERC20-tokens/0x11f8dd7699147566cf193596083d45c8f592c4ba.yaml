  Ethereum  code  is an Ethereum-based decentralized world knowledge base which rewards users with app
  tokens for peer-reviewing and contributing information. We aim to be the starting point of the internet
  for finding reliable, accurate information. Our long-term vision is to develop a knowledge base API
  that developers can use to create next generation decentralized applications in Artificial Intelligence,
  Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and more.
