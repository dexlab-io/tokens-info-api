  We are building the first blockchain based &lsquo;image mining&rsquo; network for augmented reality
  or any other computer vision system, such as the Lampix product. We are creating a new blockchain that
  will hold {image,description} data-sets of real world objects. This data is a vital prerequisite for
  augmenting reality systems ranging from smartphones, wearable glasses, or our own Lampix product. We
  will use PIX tokens to grow the data ecosystem through purchases and payments.
