  Basic Attention Token radically improves the efficiency of digital advertising by creating a new token
  that can be exchanged between publishers, advertisers and users. It all happens on the Ethereum blockchain.

  The token can be used to obtain a variety of advertising and attention-based services on the Brave platform.
  The utility of the token is based on user attention, which simply means a person&rsquo;s focused mental
  engagement.
