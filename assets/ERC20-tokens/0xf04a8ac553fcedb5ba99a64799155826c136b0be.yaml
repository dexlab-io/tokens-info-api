  Flixx is Flixxo&rsquo;s token. It is used by users to watch videos, by producers to monetize their work
  and incentivize the network, and by advertisers to pay for a moment of your attention. Then advertisers
  need to buy Flixx from content producers, creating a complete, closed and organic token economy.

  We are using ethereum ERC-20 standard for creating a token that is freely transferable and super secure.
  There is a fixed amount of Flixx, which means that there will never be another Flixx token issued.
