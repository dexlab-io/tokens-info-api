  IndiCoin is an autonomous cryptocurrency and a social service platform built on top of Ethereum Blockchain
  that enables users to provide social proof to the blockchain community through a decentralized and transparent
  voting process thereby incentivizing and encouraging the user to create an inclusive community of people
  who are incentivized to do social tasks. it is the first ever social platform where people can not only
  contribute but also validate through any kind of content posted anonymously from anywhere, anytime and
  also earn through it. IndiCoin is developed to address the broken social sector. We are building a DApp
  where one can share any proof of work such as live videos, images, illegal document leak, e-way bills
  for which our DApp will provide full anonymity and in exchange provide Indi tokens. Along with that,
  we'll be addressing poverty, child labor, proper sanitation, education, bringing drinking water accessible
  to everyone and million other test cases. IndiCoin token sale would be the first ever Token Sale/ICO
  officially covering India. Our mission is to create awareness among 1.2 billion unaware Indians about
  cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem also create a sense of social accountability among individuals.
