  Chainlink (LINK) is the first decentralized oracle network; allowing anyone to securely provide smart
  contracts with access to key external data, off-chain payments and any other API capabilities. Anyone
  who has a data feed, useful off-chain service such as local payments, or any other API, can now provide
  them directly to smart contracts in exchange for LINK tokens.
