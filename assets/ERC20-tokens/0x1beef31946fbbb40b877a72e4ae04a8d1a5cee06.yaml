  Parachute is a community engaged in helping early stage companies build their initial community through organized
  airdrops on the Parachute platform. In addition to launching a coin wallet for airdropped tokens, Parachute is
  developing an exchange platform to trade these newly minted tokens where PAR (Parachute Token) will serve as the
  medium of exchange. Additionally, the team envisions further utility and spend options with PAR, such as voting
  rights and profit sharing capabilities.
