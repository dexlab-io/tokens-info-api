  Envion builds fully automatized mobile mining units inside standardized intermodal shipping
  containers that can be shipped to any location in the world within days or weeks. Envion
  mining units use low-priced green energy directly at the source — near the shore, in the desert
  or in other remote locations. The EVN token is an ERC-20 Ethereum-based token that grants their
  holders the right to receive 100% of the earnings from Envion's proprietary mining operation,
  35% of Envion’s earnings with third-party operations and voting rights.
