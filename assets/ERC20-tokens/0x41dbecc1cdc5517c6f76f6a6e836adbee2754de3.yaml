  Medicalchain is a decentralized platform that enables secure, fast and transparent exchange and
  usage of medical data. Medicalchain will enable different healthcare agents such as doctors,
  hospitals, laboratories, pharmacists and insurers to request permission to access and interact
  with medical records. Each interaction is auditable, transparent, and secure, and will be
  recorded as a transaction on a distributed ledger.
