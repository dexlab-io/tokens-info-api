  The IUNGO will provide public Wi-Fi access. Service providers will be deploying Wi-Fi sites by
  installing and registering access points for public use. Service consumers will be able to use the
  IUNGO mobile wallet application or the IUNGO website to locate sites providing access to the IUNGO
  network. When in radio proximity to an active access point, a consumer's device will access
  internet services and pay for services used. There will be two levels of access security and two
  payment methods available. High communication security and more flexible payment terms will be
  available to end users willing to install a IUNGO mobile wallet application.
