  oneK is an Ethereum token ERC20 with VERY LOW supply of token. K means kilo, oneK has maximum 1,000
  tokens only. The main purpose of oneK is no FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt). We sell oneK in very
  low price at ICO (1 ONEK = 0.125 ETH or 1 ETH = 8 ONEK), which is way undervalued with only one thousand
  tokens.
