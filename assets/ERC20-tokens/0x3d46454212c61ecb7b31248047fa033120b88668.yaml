  The Movement is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that is entirely owned and shaped by its
  participants. By harnessing the power of the Ethereum computing platform and related cutting-edge technologies,
  the world's first fully crowdsourced DAO is being created. Without any central leader and built from
  the ground up, the Movement supports humans on the internet to come together and create freely. New
  and innovative spaces are emerging, communities and markets governed by internet citizens are arising.
  Independent from government agendas or corporate entities, the Movement uses the latest technology to
  offer a decentralized and unstoppable breeding ground for people from all around the world to connect
  and create.
