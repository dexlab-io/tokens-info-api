  WePower is a blockchain-based green energy trading platform where everyone can buy, trade or
  invest in tokenised green energy at scale. WePower token is backed green energy and grows in real
  value. Token accrues energy from renewable energy producers who have to donate part of the energy
  produced to the token holders. WPR token holders can use or sell donated green energy, which
  provides liquidity. WePower token model was clarified with the regulator and don't fall under
  financial/securities law regulation. WePower already attracted the first clients with 1,650 MW
  capacity solar plants in Spain and Italy (WePower launch markets).
