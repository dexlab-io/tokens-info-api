  DAO.casino is a protocol defining interactions between untrusted participants in the context of online
  gambling industry. This includes two levels: game level - player&rsquo;s trust in a particular casino
  operator in the context of the game (provably fair gambling) and a business model level: i.e. game developer
  doesn&rsquo;t have to trust casino operator to get rewarded. In short: all participants that are needed
  for the system to function don&rsquo;t have to trust each other in order to cooperate.
