  Plutus is a unique mobile Bitcoin wallet for making in-store purchases at NFC terminals worldwide. Bitcoin
  is converted to fiat on-the-go, using a true peer-to-peer exchange on the Ethereum network.

  Plutons are digital tokens you earn as a reward for shopping with Plutus. Just like cash back or air
  miles on a credit card, the more you spend the more you earn. (We&rsquo;re merchant agnostic, so every
  purchase counts).

  Plutons you earn (or purchase early) will be available to convert on the Plutus exchange network, allowing
  you to make in-store purchases with zero fees on conversion.
