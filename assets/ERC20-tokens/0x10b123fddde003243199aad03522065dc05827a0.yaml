  SYN Token is used for the Synapse Network for decentralized data + machine learning models. SYN Token
  is an ERC20 standard token developed on top of the Ethereum network. The SYN token is used to both reward
  people for access to their data, support network infrastructure and fees, and reward people for committing
  to storage and compute through secondary exchange functions. Data and models can be bought and sold
  through the marketplace via fulfillment contracts (oracles, ad-hoc queries), and provenance and access
  control is kept on chain.
