  Ethereum black is a free open source project that was created by a small group of ethereum enthusiasts
  from diverse backgrounds. In contrast to the other prominent Ethereum forks, Ethereum Black was specifically
  designed from the beginning to inspire innovation in the Ethereum black ecosystem and give value to
  the vision of decentralization. Whereas the others were born from hostility and an ambition to dominate,
  Ethereum black arises from a desire to protect Ethereum and ensure that it not only maintains its position
  as the dominant cryptocurrency but continues to grow until its liberating roots stretch deep into the
  economic life of all nations.
