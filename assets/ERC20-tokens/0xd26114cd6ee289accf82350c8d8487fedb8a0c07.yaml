  OmiseGO is the answer to a fundamental coordination problem amongst payment processors, gateways and
  financial institutions. By enabling decentralized exchange on a public blockchain at high volume and
  low cost, OmiseGO provides a next-generation value transfer service operating across currencies and
  asset types. Through the OmiseGO network connected to the Ethereum mainnet, anyone will be able to conduct
  financial transactions such as payments, remittances, payroll deposit, B2B commerce, supply-chain finance,
  loyalty programs, asset management and trading, and other on-demand services, in a completely decentralized
  and inexpensive way. Further, millions of mainstream users in the largest growing economies in the world
  will be enabled to make the transition from using fiat money to using decentralized currencies such
  as ETH, BTC, and others. The OmiseGO network is intrinsically agnostic between fiat and decentralized
  money: as far as adoption and usage go, the system is constructed so that the best currencies will win.
