  DONE is a streamlined means to cut out middle-men and "hunters" of donations whose fees far outstrip
  those given to the DONE token holders via smart contract (potentially 1% of total donations), thereby
  increasing the value or "efficiency" of a donation and decreasing nonprofit organization overhead. It
  constitutes membership of a team which is incentivized to increase donations to responsible organizations
  who put their accounting systems on the public blockchain.
