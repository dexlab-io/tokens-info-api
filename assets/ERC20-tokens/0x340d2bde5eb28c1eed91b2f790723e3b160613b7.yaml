  BLOCKv, the shared protocol for the blockchain developer stack, represents the interface moment in the
  maturation of the blockchain sector. BLOCKv provides developers with the building blocks to design the
  experiential economy of the future and unlock new revenue generating opportunities for businesses within
  this growing ecosystem. The BLOCKv platform enables the creation of smart digital objects on blockchains
  unlocking the potential to rapidly engage end-users and traverse digital and real-world environments.
  These smart objects, called vAtoms (Virtual Atoms) combine code with multimedia elements and are dynamic,
  compelling digital goods that make a cryptocurrency come alive as an asset for developers, brands and
  end users. Digital objects are an increasingly important part of the human experience: from in-game
  goods, digital cards and art that we collect, to digital books and music, and items we exchange on social
  networks.
