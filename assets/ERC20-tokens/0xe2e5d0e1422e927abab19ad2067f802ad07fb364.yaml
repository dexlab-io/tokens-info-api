  Lotus Token aims to decentralize the travel marketplace using blockchain technology to lower travel-related
  costs by eliminating costly overhead transaction fees of traditional booking systems. We have recently signed
  a partnership with ORIGINPROTOCOL to improve and power-up the shared economy where decentralized systems act
  like a one-stop shop for common people to enjoy the freedom of enjoying reduced costs of decentralized services
  like travel, house/hotel bookings, etc.
