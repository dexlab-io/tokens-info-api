  LitecoinCash was built to help increase the adoption of cryptocurrency amongst average people. It was made to
  help increase the day-to-day transactions made with cryptocurrencies and help bring cryptocurrency into the
  mainstream, capitalist free market. LitecoinCash has the goal of becoming one of the top three cryptocurrencies
  that can be used for the sole purpose of being a reliable, trustless and fair medium of exchange. LitecoinCash
  wants to make everything fair and evenly distributed. It is this honest ethos and simple goal that will enable
  LitecoinCash to last for the longterm and be successfully sustained by the community.
