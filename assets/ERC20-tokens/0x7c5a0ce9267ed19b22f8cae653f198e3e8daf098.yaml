  Ever notice how things in crypto get really exciting, people start making crazy predictions, and suddenly
  at its highest point, everything turns for the worst? Then at the pit of despair, when the crowd thinks
  all is lost, fortunes suddenly turn again?

  We call this the &ldquo;sentiment wave&rdquo;, and Santiment is all about measuring crowd moods so that
  you can make ideal trading decisions. Every datafeed Santiment produces either contributes or gives
  insight into crowd sentiment, and you can make this data work for you.

  Santiment generates revenue with a regular subscription fees. Our token, the Santiment Network Token
  (SAN), is used for accessing content and datafeeds. It can either be staked, giving holders limited
  access to services for free, or it can be spent in auctions to purchase our most exclusive data. This
  connects the SAN token value directly to the value of datafeeds and information Santiment produces.
